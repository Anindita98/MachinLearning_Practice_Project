# MachinLearning_Practice_Project
A hands-on machine learning project using the Titanic dataset and logistic regression, with clearly explained steps. It provides a complete walkthrough of how to execute a machine learning project from start to finish.
# Titanic Survival Prediction ðŸš¢

This project uses Logistic Regression to predict whether a Titanic passenger survived or not based on features like Age, Fare, Pclass, and Embarked.

## Features Used
- Age (scaled)
- Fare (scaled)
- Pclass
- Sex (encoded)
- Embarked (one-hot)

## Model
- Logistic Regression
- Accuracy: ~81%
- Evaluation: Confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score

## Next Steps
- Try Random Forest
- Cross-validation
- Hyperparameter tuning
